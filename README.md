##What is Rubberduck?

It's an add-in for the VBA IDE, the glorious *Visual Basic Editor* (VBE) - which hasn't seen an update in this century, but that's still in use everywhere around the world. Rubberduck wants to give its users access to features you would find in the VBE if it had kept up with the features of Visual Studio and other IDE's in the past, oh, *decade* or so.

Rubberduck wants to help its users write better, cleaner, maintainable code. The many **code inspections** and **refactoring tools** help harmlessly making changes to the code, and **unit testing** helps writing a *safety net* that makes it easy to know exactly what broke when you made that *small little harmless modification*.

Rubberduck wants to bring VBA into the 21st century, and wants to see more open-source VBA repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/) - VBA code and **source control** don't traditionally exactly work hand in hand; unless you've automated it, exporting each module one by one to your local repository, fetching the remote changes, re-importing every module one by one back into the project, ...is *a little bit* tedious. Rubberduck integrates Git into the IDE, and handles all the file handling behind the scenes - a bit like Visual Studio's *Team Explorer*.

If you're learning VBA, Rubberduck can help you avoid a few common beginner mistakes, and can probably show you a trick or two - even if you're only ever writing *macros*. If you're a more advanced programmer, you will appreciate the richness of [Rubberduck's feature set](https://github.com/retailcoder/Rubberduck/wiki/Features). See the [Installing](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/wiki/Installing) wiki page.

If you're a C# developer looking for a fun project to contribute to, see the [Contributing](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/wiki/Contributing) wiki page.

##Software & Libraries

###[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/)

As of v1.2, Rubberduck is empowered by the awesomeness of ANTLR.

> **What is ANTLR?**

> *ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.*

We're not doing half of what we could be doing with this amazing tool. Try it, see for yourself!

###[LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp)

**What is LibGit2Sharp?**

LibGit2Sharp is the library that has allowed us to integrate Git right into the VBA IDE (and as a nice bonus, expose a nice API that handles the nitty gritty of importing source files to and from the IDE to a repo for you).

> LibGit2Sharp brings all the might and speed of libgit2, a native Git implementation, to the managed world of .Net and Mono.

**Okay, so what is [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/)?**

> libgit2 is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API, allowing you to write native speed custom Git applications in any language which supports C bindings.

Which basically means it's a reimplementation of Git in C. It also [happens to be the technology Microsoft uses for their own Git integration with Visual Studio](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GitSupportForVisualStudioGitTFSAndVSPutIntoContext.aspx).

###[WPF Localization Using RESX Files](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/35159/WPF-Localization-Using-RESX-Files)

This library makes localizing WPF applications at runtime using resx files a breeze. Thank you [Grant Frisken](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=1079060)!

###[Using Raw Input from C# to handle multiple keyboards](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17123/Using-Raw-Input-from-C-to-handle-multiple-keyboard)

A library using the Raw Input API for reacting to low level keyboard/mouse events.

##Icons

We didn't come up with these icons ourselves! Here's who did what:

###[Fugue Icons](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)
